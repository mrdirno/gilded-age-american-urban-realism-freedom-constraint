## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene from the perspective of Mrs. Riordan, the alterations shop owner, as she balances her own precarious ledger of survival and power.
- Imagine a chapter where the man in the expensive, fraying suit from Chapter 1 encounters Cora later in the story. Who is he, and what does his 'fraying' represent?
- Create the photographic survey entry Silas Aldridge would write to accompany a portrait of Cora. What does he see that she does not?
- Write Elsie's internal monologue during a political rally or strike, contrasting her 'hot coal' view of collective action with Cora's observational patience.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Text of the Street' generator that creates a sensory catalog (sights, sounds, smells, textures) for a random Gilded Age city block, filtered through Cora's analytical perspective.
- Design a 'Constraint Engine' interactive narrative where the player, as Cora, must allocate limited resources (time, money, energy) across mending work, household survival, and personal agency, with each choice affecting her relationships and future opportunities.
