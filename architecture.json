  "cover_prompt": "A young woman, Cora Dawson, sits hunched in a pool of lamplight, her hands paused mid-stitch over a sumptuous gown, her gaze not on her work but lifted towards a grand, unseen party visible only as blurred, golden light through a frosted glass door, her expression one of quiet, penetrating observation. The scene is her cramped, fabric-strewn workroom in the attic of a Gilded Age mansion, walls papered with peeling floral patterns, shelves overflowing with spools of thread and bolts of luxurious silk, a single small window offering a hazy, distant view of the city's glittering skyline, contrasting her world of necessary toil with the world of opulent leisure she services. In the atmospheric style of Edward Hopper, capturing urban solitude and psychological tension, and the detailed textile realism of Daniel F. Gerhartz. Book cover framing, centered composition with a dramatic low-angle view from the sewing table upwards, emphasizing Cora's elevated gaze and the looming door of light. Chiaroscuro lighting with a stark contrast between the warm, diffused gold bleeding from the door and the cool, shadowy blues of her workroom, palette of deep navys, rich velvets, burnished golds, and the pale ivory of the unfinished gown. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
